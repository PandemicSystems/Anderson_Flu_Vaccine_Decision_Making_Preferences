We constructed a measure of health decision-making preferences using 2016 (N = 1005) and 2018 (N = 1020) population representative surveys of U.S. adults 18 years old and older, drawn from the National Opinion Research Centerâ€™s (NORC) AmeriSpeak Panel. We used hierarchical ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to determine the relative explanatory power of health decision-making preferences in predicting vaccine confidence, vaccine hesitancy, recent vaccination behavior and future vaccination intention.

Survey data used for analysis available upon request.
